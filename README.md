Known issues:

Some people seem to have a problem with missing english audio when changing the language from English to Polish. Leaving only en.sb and en.toc files, and deleting the others in Data/Win32/Loc and Patch/Win32/Loc seems to fix that. 

The language may be changed to other than was set as a target, simply change it in game options in that case, desired language will be available there.
